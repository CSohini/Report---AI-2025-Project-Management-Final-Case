Answered these questions:
SOW: 
Create a new Project Charter that clearly defines:
1. The role of the IT group, how you as their representative will manage and lead the project.
2. How you will measure success, focused on the bigger Company goal
3. Address and document any information gaps that are needed to succeed
4. Propose a new Fee structure for yourself – base this on incentives aligned with The Company’s goals (which should align later with KPIs and Metrics)

Schedule in MS Project: 
Create a new or updated MS Project schedule that shows:
1. A broader view of the entire project including the Wall Street issues, media events, layoffs, etc.
2. Key decision dates needed and by whom (assign roles)
3. Key milestones aligned with Company Goals and all events (beyond IT)
4. Make sure the schedule clearly ties to the project management technique you suggested in the original email reply to Liz (Sprint, Agile Traditional, etc)
5. Please describe if the schedule “works” to meet the proposed completion date?

Budget: 
Create your cost Budget for your services and your team (not for the larger project and TPZ):
1. Aligns with the description you put into the Charter regarding your fees
2. Includes your incentive structure and KPIs
3. Please describe if $500,000 is enough of a fee? Should you ask for more?
   
Closeout (interim):
Create an interim “Lessons Learned” report regarding the Project, from a point of view of where it stands now, and offer solutions. Do not hold back on addressing specific people and issues, but please describe in a professional, consultative manner. Focus on what would have made his better from the start
1. The information gaps
2. Personalities and conflicts
3. Roles, Org structure
4. Other engagement issues you see
